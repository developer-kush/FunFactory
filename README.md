Hi, I'm Kushagra Agarwal and I welcome you to my project : )
This is a simple website designed and styled using Bootstrap-4
The site demonstrates the use of different Bootstrap Components 
and is designed to be a website with fun elements like games etc.


To begin testing the work,

download this repository in your own system and unzip if needed.

you can also use `git clone https://github.com/kushagra-2709/Fun_Factory-Minor-Bootstrap-4-Project.git` through command shell, if you have git installed in your system
to clone this repository directly from github into your system

Next, if you haven't installed yet, install node.js and npm in your system

Now, you have to install all the dependencies in your system, for this, simply type
`npm install` in your command shell and press ENTER


The project uses lite-server as a dependency to run on a local temporary server.
To initiate the server, put the command `npm start` in your shell and press ENTER
